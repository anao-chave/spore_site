Or you can be a also a herbevorous species, but trought your decisons became a interplanetery dictator. You chose your fate and destiny, the main go of the game is to reach the center of the galaxy, but you can do what you want to reach it.<p><br>


<h2><a id="stages">When we talk about spore's gameplay, it is really important to mention that the game has five stages:<h2>
<ol id="stages">
<li class="cell"><a href="#titlecell">Celular</a></li>
<li class="creature"><a href="#creature_title">Creature</a></li>
<li class="tribal"><a href="#tribal_title">Tribal</a></li>
<li class="city"><a href="#city_title">City </a></li>
<li class="space"><a href="#space_title">Spacial</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="cell" id="titlecell"> The celular stage </h2>
<image src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17390/0000006448.1920x1080.jpg?t=1642702281" width= 50% height=60%> 
<p class="cell" id="especial"> This is the first stage from the game, you arrive from a metiore and now you are part of this planet ecosystem, as a tiny cell. Here you will need to eat so earn DNA points and grow to evolve. In the beggining of the game you can chose to be a vegetarian species or a carnivorous species, if you are a carnivorouos you need to use your creature to kill others and eat their meat. If you are a vegetarian you need to eat plants and survive predadors attacks. You can use the DNA points you earned by eating when you mate with another one of your species, you do this by clicking a button. After you mate a egg is born, and you can edit the creature inside this egg to buy upgrades for example spikes or better locomotion, this will cost you DNA points, so I'ts always good saving it. After you grow enough you can get your legs in the next matting and evolve to the next stage!</p>
<h2 class="creature" id="creature_title">The creature stage</h2>
<img src="https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/gamelife/images/2008/05/28/spore_creature_2_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg" width=60%>
<p  class="creature" > Now you have a leg and a tribe, but you are not alone in this world. Insted of simply eating to evolve you have two opitions, you can eighter became friend with other tibres trought posing, singing and dancing, or you can murder all their male alphas and extermine the babys trought punhces, screthces, charges and poison to win DNA points. The more tribres you kill/becomes friend the bigger your brain becomes, you can still mate to spend DNA in usefull upgrades, but after some time of evolving you are able to call friends from your tribe to help you in your missions. The more you evolve the more members you can call. After becoming big brain enought you and your mates descover fire and decide to create a primitive tribe, wich is our next stage! </p>
<h2 class="tribal" id="tribal_title">The tribal stage</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/17390/0000006440.600x338.jpg?t=1642702281">
<p class="tribal"> In this stage you will start the first steps to build a civilization! Here you will use food as a resource, if your animal was herbivorous you can colect food or tame a creature and colect it eggs for food. If you were a carnivorous you can colect food eighter by fishing, killing less evolved animals or taming them. In this stage you will evolve by allying or disimating the other tribes, you can ally with them by singing musics, with diferent instruments and trained musitions. You can attack them using different 3 types of weapons and healers, and create your own strategies to have a beter position at combat. After you are done with the other tribres you will evolve and creat a ctitie, where your next stage will start!</p>

<img src="http://guidesmedia.ign.com/guides/735340/images/590/spore_space_137.jpg">
<p> In this stage you will not control creatures, you will control tanks, airplanes and boats. You will mainly edit your cities, so they become the most lucrative and happy as possible. For winning this stage you must conquer all the other cities. for doing this you have 3 opitions, the first one is trought religion. This cars will go into other cities and orquerstrate attacks to spread the world of your God and the citie owners will try to stop this by breaking your cars with guns.

<h2 class="evolution" id="evolution_title">Why is the evolution part wrong?</h2>
<img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-bc40209dc90baa7ce9fd75aeee7aa927.webp">
<p class="evolution"> So, I really love this game, but the evolution idea is passed in a completly wrong way, and the problem is that the game sells it self as an evolution game. In the game one baby is born with a toon of different modifications, that are not developed by the enviroment, but by a inteligent degsiner. In real life small changes take a lot of time to occor, and they are made by the enviroment and the survival of the fittest. In the game this does not happen, and it is one inacurace.</p>
<h2 class="my" id="my_title"> My gameplay </h2>
<p class="my"> I alredy played all the paths pre space stage, and it is really nice to see your creatures evolving. I tryed all the paths and I can afirm that using the carnivorous + violent path in the hard mode it's pretty cool. You need to use stretegies during the tribal stage involving caiting and spliting and conquering. Also in the citie stage you need be be with your eyes opened all the time. 3 minutes without checkin in one nation could mean death. Making friends in the creature part is also pretty fun, because they will join your group when you became a bit smarter, ad you can call some beffy boys to help you solve old issues. </p>
<h2 class="why" id="why_title"> Why is this game so special to me?</h2>
<p class="why"> Before starting to talking about why this universe of this game is so beutifull I would like to mention how I discovered this game and my whole history with it. I saw a series on youtube in 2016(this game is from 2008), I imediatly fell in love with the game and bought it on steam and them started my adventure. I talked with a friend at school that also played the game and he adiviced me to start as a herbivorous because it was esier, so as soon as I arrived home I opened the game and started my 6 year long saga. I started my first creature, called:"Fransino", and after a lot of effort, trial and error the Fransinos reached space. After that point I started griding for money, and afther two weeks I started playing a new game, because I was tierd of the same griding. Arround one year later I decided to play Spore again, but with a new civilization. The brutals and merceless: "Azul59x" this guys never made a peace deal trought their hole existence, and when I reached the space stage I made one alience and started bombing and nuking everyone arround me. I wasn't interested in reaching the center of the galaxy with them,
     I just wanted to creat a giant empire. After one month of pillaging in desiming entire planets and ecosystems I got bored and started playing other things. And again, after 1 year I decided to play a bit more with Azul59x and then start 3 new civilizations, each one following a different path. I would stop when I reached the space stage. This was pretty cool and after concluding it I took a break from spore. 2 years later in 2020 the pandemic came, and I had a lot of free time, so I decided to try spore again. I started doing speed runs until the space stage and arround 2020 and 2021 I met Marcão, he is 1 year older then me in school, so we talked more online. We started competing against each other in spore speed runs, and he won almost everysngle one of them, but in the hollidays we did a ton of remaches and we ended up in a balance between win and loses. After ending my Saga with Marcão I decided to end my dream from 10 year's old me. And after a lot of grinding I could reach the center of the galaxy, end the game, terramform a lot of planets to increase the level of my colonies and reduce by half the size of the strongest empire of the game.
      It was really cool to see myself from 5/6 years ago and myself from the present could build something together and apreciate how far we got. Spore is not just a game, it is a galaxy, and a lot of it was hand made by the developers, more then 10 thousen stars and planets you can visit, different ecosistems, a vast amount of places to explore. When you are playing Spore you are only limited by your own creative and how much you want to play the game. Now a days, when I open Spore I see a time capsule, When I see my old empires I remember what I used to do in each year of those empires creation and how my surroundings were like. I love Spore, and despite being a faliure in the view of moderm critics that don't want to bring a game to it limits and are terrified by the ugly graphics I still love what this game made me built and expirience. All the good moments that it brought me and the good moments that it still brings to me. If you want to have an amazing experience with games, stop juging them by how much money was invested in the project, or how good are the graphics. Start enjoying a game by what you built with it and how it changed you. Try playing old games and try not following the path they want you to follow, that's all I had to say. Goodbye.
